# Abstract
Our work provided the Military Objects In Real Combat (MOCO) dataset, which includes 7449 images with 37245
captions, and has the advantage of offering a rich set of captions for real military combat scenarios. This dataset is
particularly beneficial for the research on military image captioning, as it provides a large and diverse collection of
images accompanied by detailed captions. The open access nature of the MOCO dataset also ensures that it can
be widely utilized by the research community, fostering innovation and collaboration in the field of military image
analysis.
